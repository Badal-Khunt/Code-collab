# CodeCollab 🚀

CodeCollab is a simple CRUD-based web application designed to demonstrate core full-stack development concepts using a lightweight technology stack. The project focuses on managing shared data through Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations in a clear and practical way.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

CodeCollab provides a minimal web interface where users can manage shared records (such as notes or code snippets). The application is built to clearly show how a frontend interacts with a backend and a database, making it ideal for learning and assessment purposes.

The project follows an agile, sprint-based development approach.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Demonstrate full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Show interaction between frontend, backend, and database
- Use a simple and understandable technology stack
- Follow structured project planning and sprint workflows
- Build a maintainable and easy-to-extend application

## 🔁 CRUD Operations

The application is centered around managing a single core entity (e.g. notes or code snippets).

- **Create:** Add new records through a web form  
- **Read:** View all records or a single record from the database  
- **Update:** Edit existing records  
- **Delete:** Remove records when no longer needed  

These operations provide a clear demonstration of data persistence and backend logic.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

The project intentionally uses a simple and widely adopted stack:

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Frontend:** HTML and CSS  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Containerization:** Docker  

This stack ensures clarity, simplicity, and ease of deployment.
